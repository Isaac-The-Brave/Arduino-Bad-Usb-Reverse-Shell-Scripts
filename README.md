# Arduino-Reverse-Shell-Scripts

These are scripts made for the Badusb, an Arduino Leonardo that acts as if it's a hardware input device. Using these scripts, one can quickly download a 
powershell payload by just putting their USB stick in someone else's computer. If your payload is detected easily by viruses, just disable windows defender 
while you're at it!
